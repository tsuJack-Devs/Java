Introduction
-
I like to thinking about algorithm. Ever since I came across the wonder of sorting numbers. I am fascinated to see some YouTube videos about bar graphs animating until it gets sorted out. This got me thinking, what if I code one myself. So here it is. Swing Sorting Visualizer came to life. I just wanted to see how my sorting algorithm works too.

Goals
-
Personally, I wanted this app to simply show sorting works right in front of me. One time a new idea struck me of why not adding a functionality to sort numbers using a custom Java class code so students like us can see how our original sorting algorithm animates. Thus, I made this app somewhat educational-friendly.

Conclusion
-
Sorry I am lacking of words to say.
Just use the app!
